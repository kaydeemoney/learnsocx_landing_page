            <h2>Why is Video Marketing so effective in today's digital age?</h2>
            <p>
                Video marketing is incredibly effective because it engages audiences like no other medium can. Over 80% of internet traffic comes from video, and platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, and social media are optimized for video content. Videos can tell stories, demonstrate products, or show behind-the-scenes footage in a way that captures attention and keeps viewers engaged.
